                <p>So you have decided to sell your property. Before anything else, it is a good idea to sit down and clarify your motivations and draw up a basic time frame for the selling process.</p>
                <h3>Why Sell?</h3>
                <p>Why do you want to sell your property? Do you intend to simply find a larger property, or do you plan on moving to another neighborhood, school district, city or state? You might think your reasons are obvious, but it would do well to consider the implications of each option for your lifestyle, opportunities, and finances. Being clear about your intentions for selling will make it easier for us to determine the most appropriate option for your specified financial, lifestyle, and real estate goals.</p>
                <h3>When Should I Sell?</h3>
                <p>You should immediately establish your time frame for selling. If you need to sell quickly, we can speed up the process by giving you a complete market analysis and action plan to obtain all of your goals. If there is no pressing need to sell immediately, you can sit down with one of our expert real estate agents to thoroughly review the current market conditions and find the most favorable time to sell.</p>

                <h3>Why Should You Choose Nina Wilson and Promise Land Properties? </h3>
                <p>You may opt to sell your property independently. There are many excellent reasons, however, why you should choose Nina to assist you in this important undertaking. Nina will ensure that you maximize your opportunities in the current real estate market and she will employ the most effective marketing and advertising strategies for your property. Promise Land Properties will also guide you through the complicated paperwork involved, from the initial agreement to the final documents.</p>

                <h3>What to Look For In a Real Estate Professional. </h3>
                <p>The following are a couple of factors to keep in mind when looking for a listing agent:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Education.</strong> The most important factor in choosing a real estate professional is their education in the real estate industry. Nina is a Realtor which requires. Our professionals have advanced training and education, allowing them to be among the top agents in the world and earning prestigious designations in the various fields of real estate.</li>
                  <li><strong>Experience and Expertise.</strong> You want a full-time realtor who is familiar with your area and with the type of property you intend to sell. Does he or she employ a diverse range of marketing and advertising strategies? How tech-savvy is your realtor? </li>
                  <li><strong>Availability and Commitment.</strong> Your realtor should be capable of prompt and decisive action during the course of selling your property. Does your realtor make it a point to keep in touch with you constantly? Can your realtor easily be contacted in case of emergencies or even for the simplest questions?</li>
                  <li><strong>Rapport.</strong> Does your realtor take the time to listen to your goals and clarify your needs? Can your realtor understand your unique situation and be genuinely concerned about the outcome of the process? Your realtor will be your guide and partner in this crucial decision, so it is important to find one with whom you can get along.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What Is Your Property Worth?</h3>
                <p>Without a realtor, most independent property sellers tend to overestimate the value of their property. You can avoid this pitfall by consulting with an experienced realtor.</p>

            <div class="content" id="bottomContent2">
                <p>You can do a lot to increase the appeal of your property and to create a lasting impact on potential buyers.</p>
                <h3>What to Do To Prepare:</h3>
                <p>The following are a couple of factors to keep in mind when listing your property for sale: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Curb Appeal.</li>
                    <p>Keeping your landscape pristine, and adding creative touches to your yard, such as colorful annuals, will create an immediate impact on passers-by and potential buyers.</p>
                    <li>Property Repairs.</li>
                    <p>Simple upgrades such as window repairs, polishing the doorknobs, and a fresh coat of paint in the most frequently used rooms will instantly brighten up the property.</p>
                    <li>Cleanliness and Staging.</li>
                    <p>Keep your property uncluttered, sweet-smelling and well-lit from top-to-bottom. Pay attention to details: put away the kitty litter, place a vase of fresh flowers near the entryway, pop a batch of cinnamon rolls in the oven, have your carpets cleaned. Your agent will scan the property before it is listed for sale to see how you can improve the staging of your property.</p>
                    <li>Disclosures and Inspections. </li>
                    <p>We are very familiar with the legal procedures involved in disclosures and are ready to help you develop a thorough disclosure statement beneficial to both you and the buyer, as well as suggest home improvement measures before placing your property on the market (such as termite and pest inspections).</p>
                    <li>Showtime.</li>
                    <p>Presenting your property to potential buyers is a job that we will take care of for you. Buyers feel more comfortable discussing the property with the agent, if you are not there. Moreover, your agent will know what information will be most useful in representing your interests when speaking with prospective buyers.</p>
                </ol>

            <div class="content" id="bottomContent3">
                <h3>The Price Is Not Always Right.</h3>
                <p>“The higher the price, the better the offer.” Do not let yourself be fooled by this popular misconception. Price is not always the determining factor when accepting an offer for several important reasons: the initial offer is usually not final, and there are a number of terms and conditions that may influence the final outcome of a price. You can trust Nina to help you thoroughly evaluate every proposal without compromising your marketing position.</p>

                <h3>Negotiating the Right Way.</h3>
                <p>Nina takes the ethical responsibility of fairly negotiating contractual terms very seriously and is constantly looking for a win-win agreement that is beneficial to all parties involved. You may even have to deal with multiple offers before ratifying the one you judge to be the most suitable for you – and Nina will guarantee a thorough and objective assessment of each offer to help you make the right choice.</p>

                <h3>The Initial Agreement and Deposit.</h3>
                <p>An effective agreement is a legal arrangement between a potential purchaser and the property’s seller. Consideration (initial and additional deposit) is to be held at the title company’s escrow account pending the fulfillment of conditions of the effective agreement.</p>

                <p>Some important tips to keep in mind to streamline the process even further:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Keep written records of everything.</strong>
                      <p>All the paperwork for your sale and make sure that you have copies of everything.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Stick to the schedule.</strong>
                      <p>Now that you have chosen your offer, you and the buyer will be given a timeline to mark every stage in the process of closing the real estate contract. Meeting the requirements on time ensures a smoother flow of negotiations and also ensures that each party involved is not in breach of their agreements. During the process we will keep you constantly updated so you will always be prepared for the next step.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <!-- bottomContent4 -->
            <div class="content" id="bottomContent4">
                <h3>Inspections and Appraisals</h3>
                <p>Most buyers will have the property inspected by a licensed property inspector within the time frame that was agreed upon in the effective contract to purchase. Some buyers will have several different inspectors inspect the property, if they wish to obtain professional opinions from inspectors who specialize in a specific area (e.g. roof, HVAC, structure). If the agreement is conditional upon financing, then the property will be appraised by a licensed appraiser to determine the value for the lending institution via third party. This is done so that the lending institution can confirm their investment in your property is accurate...</p>

                <h3>The Title Company.</h3>
                <p>A title company or an attorney will be selected as the closing agent, whose job is to examine and insure clear title to real estate. After researching the complete recorded history of your property, they will certify that 1) your title is free and clear of encumbrances (e.g. mortgages, leases, or restrictions, liens) by the date of closing; and 2) all new encumbrances are duly included in the title.</p>

                <h3>Option Periods</h3>
                <h3>During an option period the buyer has purchased the right to</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inspecting the property. The buyer has the right to determine the condition of your property by subjecting it to a wide range of inspections, such as roof, termite/pest, chimney/fireplace, property boundary survey, well, septic, pool/spa, arborist, mold, lead based paint, HVAC, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Depending on the outcome of these inspections, one of two things may happen:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Either each milestone is successfully closed, the contingencies will be removed, bringing you one step closer to the closing; or</li>
                  <li>The buyer, after reviewing the property and the papers, requests a renegotiation of the terms of contract (usually the price).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>How do you respond objectively and fairly to the buyer when a renegotiation is demanded, while acting in your best interests? This is when a Nina and her expertise in negotiations can make a real difference in the outcome of the transaction.</p>
                <h3>Loan Approval and Appraisal.</h3>
                <p>A good rule of thumb is to suggest that you accept buyers who have a lender’s pre-approval, approval letter, or written loan commitment, which is a better guarantee of loan approval than a pre-qualification or no documentation from a lending institute. Expect an appraiser from the lender’s company to review your property and verify that the sales price is appropriate.</p>
